## 🔸 About

This is my pet project.  Here I practice writing a `FastAPI` backend and look for useful practices.  I conceived this project as a kind of server that will be pulled by various applications, for example, a telegram bot.  I also attached the admin panel here at /admin, using the `sqladmin` lib for this.  Authorization occurs with the help of `Fastapi-users`. 

## 🔹 Credits

The tarot theme was inspired by my beloved wife, thank you! 🐷 Finding a topic for a project is not always easy, but here it even turned out interesting, lol.
